# WHO-Life-Expectancy-Prediction


In this project, predictor variables are stored in X dataframe and response variable is stored in Y dataframe. Using Automatic Machine Learning H2O AutoML to make prediction on life expectancy of a certain population. Various plots like Variable Importance Plot, Partial Dependence Plot, Individual Conditional Expectation Plot and SHAP Summary Plot is explained below to explain how each of our feature input affects our model prediction.
